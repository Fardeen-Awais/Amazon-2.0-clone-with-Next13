1Ô∏è‚É£ #0001: 

I'm personally stuck here for two days. 

Context of my problem :

I am using next 13, i'm trying to fetch data in the page.js with the help of getServerSideProps.

But the problems is that i'm stuck on it without reading the docs of next 13. In the docs, this is clearly mention in the bold :

|" Good to know: Previous Next.js data fetching methods such as getServerSideProps, getStaticProps, and getInitialProps are not supported in the new app directory "|

I personally don't understand the real problem is but now i can simply solve it by using fetch inside my component.
